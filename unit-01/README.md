## Random Quote Generator

For this project, I created an app that displays a random literary quote each time a button is clicked.

Each quote includes an attributed source, citation, year and tag.

As well, the background color is changed randomly along with the quote.

This quote/color-change is automatically updated every 20 seconds.
