## List Pagination and Filtering

### Description

Using vanilla, unobtrusive JavaScript and a development approach of progressive enhancement, this application dynamically displays a list of student profiles with a working search bar.

These profiles appear 10 per page, with a series of working pagination links based on the number of initial list items and/or search results.

On a search yielding 0 results, a message is displayed on the page informing the user that no results have been found.

Throughout, code comments clearly explain how each JavaScript function works.
