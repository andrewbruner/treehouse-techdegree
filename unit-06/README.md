# Team Treehouse<br>Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree<br>Unit 06

## Static Node.js and Express Site

### Description

This project highlights all of Andrew Bruner's completed units (so far) in the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. They are included in a self-hosted personal portfolio website using Node.js and Express, built with Pug webpage templating.

The user/prospective employer is welcomed to an initial landing page, with links to an about page and various project pages for each Techdegree unit. On a page error or requested non-existent page, a helpful message is printed to the console and browser indicating a 404 or other status, message and stack trace.

### Custom Styles

This project achieves custom styles to help complete the 'exceeds expectations' rubric requirement. Those styles include...

- a custom background color of `gold`
- a site-wide font-family of `monospace`
- a fade-in animation for the main content area on every page load

*See the bottom of the `public/style.css` file for full details on style implementation, or navigate to `static/css/style.css` inside the portfolio site.*
