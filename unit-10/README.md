# **`courses-admin`: a Full Stack App with React and a REST API**

`courses-admin` is a simple school database administration system.

Users can view, create, update or delete courses from a school database.

In addition, users must create an account and sign in to make changes to this database, with various permissions and validation requirements established throughout the application.

## Utilized Technologies

* JavaScript and JSX for modular component creation
* React Router for basic route setup
* Fetch API for requesting data from the REST API
* Basic Authentication/Cookies for user sign-in support
